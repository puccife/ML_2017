# Project 1
This project counts to 10% of the final grade in the Machine Learning course [ **CS-433** ].
We are asked to do  exploratory data analysis on the HIGGS dataset to understand and explore the features.
Furthermore, feature processing and engineering is used to clean the dataset and exrtact more meaningful information.
We then use several machine learning methods to analyze the model and generate predictions that are later submitted to Kaggle platform. [ Private leaderboard ]
